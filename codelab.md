**Task:** Add CSV export functionality to the Todo app

Create a New Task by clicking on the "+" sign 

### The Prompt

Copy and paste this into Jules:

```markdown
Implement "Export CSV" in index.html for the app.
Requirements:
- Add an "Export CSV" button beside Export JSON.
- CSV headers: id,title,completed,createdAt,dueAt
- Escape commas/quotes; UTF-8; downloadable filename todos.csv
- Keep code minimal and idiomatic; do not break existing features.
Provide tests/checks or clear manual validation notes.
```

###  The Workflow

1. **Start the Task**
   - Jules analyzes, plans, and opens a PR
   - Runs in secure cloud VMs with direct GitHub integration

2. **Review Phase**
   - Read Jules' plan
   - Inspect the code diff
   - Test the branch locally (optional)

3. **Validation**
   - Click the new **Export CSV** button
   - Verify headers and data escaping
   - Check file download works

4. **Merge Decision**
   - Merge if it meets acceptance criteria
   - Request changes if needed

>  Watch Jules work in real-time - it's like having a coding pair partner.

##  Step 5: Create Agent-Friendly Issues

### What Makes a Good Issue?

Issues can be:
-  **Bug reports** - Something that's broken
-  **Feature requests** - New functionality  
-  **Documentation** - Improvements to docs
-  **Refactoring** - Code improvements

###  Let's Create Three Issues

We'll create these issues and run at least two live during the workshop.

<details>
<summary><strong> How to Create a GitHub Issue</strong></summary>

1. **Navigate to Issues**
   - Click the "Issues" tab in your GitHub repository

2. **Create New Issue**
   - Click the green "New Issue" button

3. **Fill in Details**
   - Enter a descriptive title
   - Add relevant details in the description
   - Click "Submit new issue"

</details>


### Issue A: Due Date & Sorting

**Title:** `feat: Add due date & sorting`

**Description:**
```
Add an optional `dueAt` (date) per todo. Show due date in the list. Add a sort toggle: **Created | Due Date | Completed**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Backward compatible with existing saved data
- Sort persists during the session  
- No breaking changes to existing features
```

---

###  Issue B: Inline Edit Bug

**Title:** `bug: Inline edit does not work`

**Description:**
```
When double-clicking to edit, instead it marks the todo item as completed.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Double-clicking a todo item opens the inline editor
- Editing and pressing Enter saves changes
- Editing and pressing Escape cancels
- Clicking outside cancels edit mode
- Changes persist after page reload
```

---

###  Issue C: Search & Overdue Filter

**Title:** `feat: Search & "Overdue" filter`

**Description:**
```
Add a text search that filters by title (debounced). Add a quick filter **Overdue** = `dueAt < today && !completed`.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Search works with active/completed filters
- Overdue filter combines with search predictably
```

---

###  Trigger Jules with Labels

> Add the `jules` label to any issue to automatically trigger Jules to work on it.

<details>
<summary><strong> How to Add a Label to an Issue</strong></summary>

1. **Open the Issue**
   - Navigate to the issue you want to label in GitHub

2. **Add the Label**
   - On the right sidebar, click the gear icon next to "Labels"
   - Select the `jules` label from the dropdown
   - Or type `jules` to create it if it doesn't exist

3. **Watch the Magic**
   - The label is immediately applied
   - Within seconds, Jules picks up the task
   - Jules will create a PR once the work is complete

</details>

> **Live Demo:** We'll label one of these issues and watch Jules work in real-time!

##  Step 6: Review Gates & Best Practices

###  Quality Control Framework

While Jules works, here are the **review gates** we follow:

####  **Pre-Work Review**
- [ ] **Clear acceptance criteria** in the issue
- [ ] **Small, focused scope** - one feature per issue
- [ ] **Well-defined requirements** - no ambiguity

####  **During Development**
- [ ] **Small, incremental diffs** - easy to review
- [ ] **Manual validation steps** provided
- [ ] **No breaking changes** to existing features

####  **Post-Work Validation**
- [ ] **Review** → **Validate** → **Merge**
- [ ] Test the feature manually
- [ ] Verify acceptance criteria are met

### The Mental Model

> **"Jules as a intermediate teammate"**
> 
> - **Engineers:** Author good issues and reviews
> - **Agent:** Does focused coding
> - **Together:** Build better software faster

Jules is a perpetually available  pair programmer

##  Step 7: Key Takeaways & Patterns

###  **What Worked Well**

- **Small scope** → Fast, focused PRs
- **Explicit acceptance criteria** → Clear success metrics  
- **Single-file app** → Simple to review and test
- **Incremental changes** → Easy to validate

###  **When to Use Jules **

**Great for:**
-  **Repetitive chores** - Boilerplate code, data migrations
-  **Clear, small features** - UI components, utility functions
-  **UI glue code** - Event handlers, form validation
-  **Data I/O** - CSV/JSON export/import, API integrations
-  **Small bug fixes** - Logic errors, edge cases
-  **Test gaps** - Unit tests, integration tests

### **When NOT to Use Jules or AI Agents Generally**

**Avoid for:**
- **Ambiguous requirements** - Need human clarification
- **Large refactors** - Complex architectural changes
- **Security-sensitive code** - Without strong guardrails
- **Business logic** - Domain-specific algorithms
- **Creative design** - UX/UI decisions

## Step 8: Stretch Goals - Auto Deployment

### Firebase Hosting + GitHub Actions

*Time permitting - let's add automatic deployment!*

### Setup Steps

#### 1. **Install Firebase CLI**
```bash
npm install -g firebase-tools
```
> Or visit: [Firebase CLI Documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli)

#### 2. **Login to Firebase**
```bash
firebase login
```

#### 3. **Initialize Firebase Hosting**
```bash
firebase init hosting
```
**Configuration:**
- ✅ Select "Create a new project" or use existing
- ✅ Set public directory as `public`
- ❌ Configure as single-page app: **No**
- ❌ Don't overwrite index.html

#### 4. **Setup GitHub Actions**
```bash
firebase init hosting:github
```
-  Accept default file locations
-  Creates `.github/workflows/firebase-hosting-merge.yml`

#### 5. **Deploy!**
Commit the changes to the repo using your IDE or cmdline
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add Firebase hosting and GitHub Actions"
git push
```

###  **The Magic Happens**

Now whenever you push to `main`:
-  **GitHub Action triggers** automatically
-  **Builds and deploys** to Firebase Hosting  
-  **Live at:** `https://[YOUR-PROJECT].web.app`

>  **Monitor:** Check deployment status in GitHub Actions tab
